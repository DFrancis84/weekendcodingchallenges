# Even Fibonacci Calculater
---

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
`1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...`
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms

## To Run Unit Tests
1. `cd internal/evenfibonacci`
2. `go test -cover`

This should return 100% coverage

## To calculate the sum of all even numbers in a fibonacci list
1. `cd cmd/evenfibonacci`
2. `go build`
3. `./evenfibonacci` followed by the cap you want the list to reach
