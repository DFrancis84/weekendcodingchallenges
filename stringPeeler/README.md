# String Peeler Challenge
------------
Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last letters of a string. Strings with two characters or less are considered invalid: provide an appropriate message for that case.

# To Run Unit Tests
1. `cd internal/stringpeeler`
2. `go test -cover`

This should return 100% coverage

# To peel your own word(s)
1. `cd cmd`
2. `go run main.go` followed by the words you would like peeled with spaces between each word.
